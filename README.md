# University-Coursework-Mobile-Computing
Game developed in swift as part of coursework for mobile computing in 2019.

This was developed during my university studies as part of my "Mobile Computing" module. It should be the completed and working version. 
However, it was developed on a Mac in the university library and since I have no access to a Mac at this moment I cannot check the state 
of this project. It is a very simple application which was intended to give me an introduction to Swift and IOS development.
